If the application does not validate user input and sanitize file paths, sensitive files such as configuration or user data can be accessed, potentially creating or overwriting files. To prevent this vulnerability, validate and sanitize any input that is used to create references to file paths. Also, enforce strict file access controls. For example, choose privileges allowing public-facing applications to access only the required files.
routes/profileImageUrlUpload.ts:23:16:warning(ssrf-deepsemgrep):          .get(url):Untrusted input might be used to build an HTTP request, which can lead to a Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. SSRF allows an attacker to send crafted requests from the server side to other internal or external systems. SSRF can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and, in some cases, allow the attacker to control applications or systems that trust the vulnerable service. To prevent this vulnerability, avoid allowing user input to craft the base request. Instead, treat it as part of the path or query parameter and encode it appropriately. When user input is necessary to prepare the HTTP request, perform strict input validation. Additionally, whenever possible, use allowlists to only interact with expected, trusted domains.
routes/profileImageUrlUpload.ts:23:16:warning(express-ssrf):          .get(url):The following request request.get() was found to be crafted from user-input `req` which can lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities. It is recommended where possible to not allow user-input to craft the base request, but to be treated as part of the path or query parameter. When user-input is necessary to craft the request, it is recommeneded to follow OWASP best practices to prevent abuse. 
routes/quarantineServer.ts:14:52:warning(express-path-join-resolve-traversal):      res.sendFile(path.resolve('ftp/quarantine/', file)):Possible writing outside of the destination, make sure that the target path is nested in the intended destination
routes/quarantineServer.ts:14:20:warning(express-res-sendfile):      res.sendFile(path.resolve('ftp/quarantine/', file)):The application processes user-input, this is passed to res.sendFile which can allow an attacker to arbitrarily read files on the system through path traversal. It is recommended to perform input validation in addition to canonicalizing the path. This allows you to validate the path against the intended directory it should be accessing.
routes/quarantineServer.ts:14:52:warning(path-join-resolve-traversal):      res.sendFile(path.resolve('ftp/quarantine/', file)):Detected possible user input going into a `path.join` or `path.resolve` function. This could possibly lead to a path traversal vulnerability,  where the attacker can access arbitrary files stored in the file system. Instead, be sure to sanitize or validate user input first.
routes/redirect.ts:19:20:warning(open-redirect-deepsemgrep):      res.redirect(toUrl as string):The application builds a URL using user-controlled input which can lead to an open redirect vulnerability. An attacker can manipulate the URL and redirect users to an arbitrary domain. Open redirect vulnerabilities can lead to issues such as Cross-site scripting (XSS) or redirecting to a malicious domain for activities such as phishing to capture users' credentials. To prevent this vulnerability perform strict input validation of the domain against an allowlist of approved domains. Notify a user in your application that they are leaving the website. Display a domain where they are redirected to the user. A user can then either accept or deny the redirect to an untrusted site.
routes/redirect.ts:19:20:warning(express-open-redirect):      res.redirect(toUrl as string):The application redirects to a URL specified by user-supplied input `query` that is not validated. This could redirect users to malicious locations. Consider using an allow-list approach to validate URLs, or warn users they are being redirected to a third-party website.
